
// EVENT LISTENER
// The change in the state of an object is known as an Event. In html, there are various events which represents that some activity is performed by the user or by the browser. When javascript code is included in HTML, js react over these events and allow the execution. This process of reacting over the events is called Event Handling. Thus, js handles the HTML events via Event Handlers.

// Mouse events:

// Event bubbling
// In the event bubbling model, an event starts at the most specific element and then flows upward toward the least specific element (the document or even window). When you click the button, the click event occurs in the following order:

//1.  button
//2. div with the id container
//3. body
//4. html
//5. document
